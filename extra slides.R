#Need to correct for age and sex which affects cell-type compostion, but also serum concentrations, metabolic enzymes, and has been shown to be associated with adherance and compliance. 

#We are not considering ethnicity as we have selected European patients. We have not as yet addressed genotypes in relation to the enzymes but have this data.

  ### Background: Differences <br> <br>
  
  .bitty[
    - Polygenic risk score (PRS) differed significantly (Ruderfer, _et al._, 2014) <br> <br>
      - Two genome-wide significant SNPs (BPD & SCZ Working Group of the PGC., 2018) <br> <br>
      - Clinical differences behavioral, cognition, intelligence (Jabben,_et al._, 2010, Parellada, _et al._, 2017) <br> <br> 
  ]

  ###Background: Epigenetics in SCZ & BPD  <br> <br> 
  
  .bitty[
    - Development: prenatal environmental factors _in utero_ <br> <br>
      - MZ twins discordant for SCZ/BPD (Dempster, _et al._, 2011) <br> <br>
      - Dynamic; many environmental exposures - trauma, adversity, life-style <br> <br>
      - Associated with brain volume, structure and function; <br> <br>
      - social and cognitive function (Starnawska & Demontis, 2021) <br> <br>
      - DNAm changes overtime as a function of age and chronicity of the disorder

  ###Background: Characteristics of SCZ & BPD <br> <br>
  
  ###Similarities
  
  .bitty[
    - Early age of onset ~ 20-30 years old <br> <br>
      - Heritability ~ 80% <br> <br>
      - Periods of stability and relapse <br> <br>
      - Dysregulated circadian rhythmicity: both a trait and state marker (Walker II, _et al._, 2020) <br> <br>
      - Medication primary form of treatment
